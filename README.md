# Tailwind Starter Kit -  Tailwind. Quick. (WIP)

Get started with [Tailwind]() quick on a [Snowpack]() based development purpose built for quick-prototypes and [HTML re-use]()

### Why?

Sometimes, it's very desirable to author HTML and CSS outside of the Frameworks like Vue and React. For the added focus, and also because it helps you build design in a better way as the classes dictating styles and your behavioural code donâ€™t get written at the the same time. Writing separately can also help you manage the authoring-time noisiness earlier, and if we can use partials like UI frameworks use components, it can help further help with migration of the HTML/CSS

The structure is designed to let you focus on coding up HTML, CSS and then split it into partials, as you do in a component-oriented framework. Once done the final mark-up can be directly transferred to your framework of choice.

This scaffold ships with

- Tailwind CSS
- PostHTML (for partials)
- Effortless custom-font application, with definition in tailwind.config.js
- A sample blog landing page layout
